# TheWorstDRM
I hate DRMs just as much as you, this is just a POC. If I planned on using it, it wouldn't be open source.
This requires a recent version of Windows 10, along with Python 3.0 - 3.6. Python 3.7 will work, but it cannot compile.
All of the dependencies will be installed with "compile.bat". The compiled exe can be found in the created "dist" folder.
